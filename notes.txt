Cypress commands (cy.visit(), cy.get(), etc.) are asynchronous, but Cypress does not use JavaScript promises directly. Instead, Cypress has its own command queue that ensures commands run in order.
Cypress commands don’t return values immediately like promises. Instead, Cypress automatically chains commands together.

We can use object destructuring while passing parameters in function where we want to pass in our order not the default one.
