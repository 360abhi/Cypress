2-Day Cypress Learning Roadmap (With Hands-On Practice)
Day 1: Cypress Fundamentals & Basic Automation
✅ Setup & Installation

Install Node.js (if not installed).
Install Cypress (npm install cypress --save-dev).
Open Cypress (npx cypress open).
✅ Understanding Cypress Architecture

How Cypress works vs. Selenium (no WebDriver, direct DOM interaction).
Cypress Test Runner UI.
✅ Writing Your First Cypress Test

Visit a webpage (cy.visit()).
Find and interact with elements (cy.get(), .type(), .click()).
Assertions (should(), contains()).
Running tests in headed/headless mode.
✅ Working with Locators & Interactions

Selecting elements (get(), contains(), find()).
Handling inputs, buttons, and links.
Custom commands (Cypress.Commands.add).
✅ Practice: Automate Login & Navigation

Create a test to log in to a web app.
Validate redirection and UI elements after login.
Day 2: Advanced Cypress & POM Implementation
✅ Cypress with Page Object Model (POM)

Create a separate file for page objects.
Store locators and methods for reusability.
Import POM in test files.
✅ Working with Fixtures & Data-driven Testing

Use fixtures to store test data (like Excel).
Read JSON data and use it in tests.
Use cy.readFile() for external data sources.
✅ Handling API Requests & UI Synchronization

Mock API responses (cy.intercept()).
Wait for network requests (cy.wait()).
✅ End-to-End Automation Practice

Automate a complete user journey (Login → Form Fill → Validation).
Read test data from an Excel file (use xlsx package).
Implement dynamic waits and retries.
Outcome: By the End of Day 2
You will have a fully automated Cypress project.
You will be able to implement POM & read data from an external file.
You will understand Cypress's unique features like auto-waiting & API mocking.
Next Steps (Optional, if time permits)
Run tests in different browsers (cypress run --browser chrome).
Continuous Integration (CI) setup with GitHub Actions.
Cypress Dashboard integration for reporting.
